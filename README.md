# üßë‚Äçüíº User Management Microservice

Welcome to the **User Management Microservice**, a critical component of a modern **Construction Management System** built using a microservices architecture. This microservice is responsible for handling **user authentication, registration, and role-based authorization** using **Keycloak** as an Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution.

---

## üß≠ Project Overview

This microservice manages all **user-related operations**, such as:
- User registration and login
- Client account creation
- Password recovery
- Fetching and updating user information
- Role creation, assignment, and management

All of these actions are secured and powered by **Keycloak**, ensuring a robust, centralized, and secure user management flow.

---

## üß± Architecture

This microservice is a part of a distributed microservice system built using:

- `Spring Boot`: for creating the service logic
- `Spring Cloud Gateway`: for API routing and centralized entry point
- `Eureka Server`: for service discovery
- `Spring Cloud Config`: for centralized configuration
- `Keycloak`: for Identity and Access Management
- `Docker & Docker Compose`: for containerization and orchestration
- `Angular`: frontend client consuming this service

The entire architecture is built with modularity, scalability, and security in mind.

## üõ°Ô∏è Keycloak Integration

**Keycloak** is an open-source Identity and Access Management solution for modern applications and services.

### üîê How Keycloak Works in This Microservice:

1. **Authentication**:  
   When a user logs in, Keycloak verifies credentials and issues a **JWT (JSON Web Token)** and a **refresh token**.

2. **Authorization**:  
   Based on the user's roles (assigned in Keycloak), they get access to specific endpoints or features.

3. **User Management**:  
   This microservice communicates with Keycloak via its Admin REST API to:
    - Create new users
    - Update user details
    - Assign or remove roles
    - Delete users
    - Handle password reset
    - Fetch user and role information

Keycloak acts as the **Single Source of Truth** for all identity and access concerns, enabling stateless, token-based security across microservices.

## üê≥ Dockerization

This microservice is designed to run in containers and is part of a Dockerized environment:

- Each microservice runs in its own container
- Keycloak server is containerized and exposed to all services
- `docker-compose.yml` is used to orchestrate services including:
    - Spring Boot services
    - Spring Gateway
    - Eureka Discovery Server
    - Spring Config Server
  

Example snippet from `docker-compose.yml` for Keycloak:

```yaml
services:
    authService-service:
    build: ./microservices/authService
    image: authManagement:latest
    container_name: authManagementContainer
    ports:
      - "8070:8070"
    depends_on:
      - eureka
      - gateway
    environment:
      - EUREKA_CLIENT_SERVICEURL_DEFAULTZONE=http://eureka:8076/eureka/
    networks:
      - microservices-network
